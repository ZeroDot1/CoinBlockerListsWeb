        <p style="font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 1pt solid #BBDF07;">Here you can find some information about the CoinBlockerLists project.</p>
        <p><strong>The <a title="CoinBlockerLists / Github" href="https://github.com/ZeroDot1/CoinBlockerLists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinBlockerLists</a> are a project to prevent illegal mining in browsers or other applications using IPlists and URLists.</strong></p>
        <p><br />It's not just to block everything without any reason, but to protect internet users from illegal mining.<br />I created this project to protect not only myself but also as many internet users as possible from illegal mining.</p>
        <p><br />If you like this project you have a company that uses the CoinBlockerLists I would be very happy about a <a title="Donate to the CoinBlockerLists" href="https://vk.cc/7TL5H2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donation</a>.<br />For this I have
          set up an Amazon wish list, money donations are not accepted.<br />I see only 1% of what normal sighted people see, and do everything completely alone, I don't have a sighted person in my environment who can support me with the project.<br />I
          do everything on my own, also this website you are currently reading is built and maintained by myself.<br />On this way I would also like to thank all of you who have donated something so far, that's really great from you. Thank you very much.<br
          />Every donation is also an motivation for me to continue and not lose the joy of being able to do something useful.<br />I will continue this project as long as I can and as long as the problem with illegal mining exists.<br />I hope this little
          project helps you to surf the internet more safely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>To protect yourself, the following lists are available for download in two formats:</strong><br /><strong>1.</strong> AllHosts - This list contains mostly minigpools and other hosts that are used for illegal mining.<br />Also the browser
          mining URLs are included in the AllHosts list to provide the best possible protection.</p>
        <p><br /><strong>2.</strong> The list ListBrowser contains only pages which are abused for browser mining.<br />There are also a few pools in the browser list, which serves to stop very hard miners.</p>
        <p><br /><strong>3.</strong> The list ListOptional contains different sites that offer mining software or simple crypto currency trading platforms.</p>
        <p><br /><strong>4.</strong> The MinigServerIPList list contains only IP addresses associated with mining or other malware attacks that refer to minig.</p>
        <p><br /><strong>5.</strong> The UBO Lste only contains browser mining URLs, this list is an additional list that Adblocker <a title="uBlock Origin / Github" href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uBlock Origin</a>          users can use additionally to the other lists.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can download all lists in the <a title="CoinBlockerLists / Downloads" href="downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Downloads</a> section for free.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, please contact me the different contact possibilities you can find on the Contact page.</p>
        <p>If you find a bug, or want to contribute to the CoinBlockerList, open an issue on Github.<br />I will look into it as soon as possible and solve any problems as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this page, I wish you much fun using all of the CoinBlockerLists.</p>
